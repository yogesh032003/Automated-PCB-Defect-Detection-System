An AI-powered web application designed to automatically detect defects in Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models. Built with a modular Flask backend and a responsive frontend, the system supports real-time webcam input, image/video uploads, detailed analytics, and an interactive dashboard.

##  Features

-  **YOLOv8-based Detection**: Real-time PCB defect detection using advanced computer vision.
-  **Multi-Source Input**: image files, and video uploads.
-  **Live Dashboard**: View total scanned PCBs, defected and OK counts, and detection accuracy.
-  **Analytics & Reports**:
  - Auto-updating Analytics.
  - Stores defected images with labels for audit and improvement.
-  **User Auth**: Secure login/registration system with role-based access.
-  **Reset Functionality**: Reset counters and analytics data on demand.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- sessionStorage for temporary file preview

**Backend:**
- Python, Flask
- OpenCV for video/image handling
- YOLOv8 (PyTorch)
- MySQL for storing user/auth/data
